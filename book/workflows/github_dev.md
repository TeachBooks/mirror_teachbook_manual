1. Navigate to the repository you want to work in and make sure you're in the correct branch.
2. Navigate to your main page (`code`) of your repository in GitHub.
3. Press the dot key on your keyboard `.` This will open VS Code.
4. In case you want to add a new file, navigate to the explorer file (the page icon) and click on the `New File` icon. This will create a new file in the folder that you are in. Give it the right extension!

In the bottom left you can see the branch you are working in.

6. Once all the changes are made it's time to commit and push. GitHub Dev requires you to use git in VS Code. You can do that in the Source Control tab in the activity bar on the left side of the window (it looks like a branching icon). Write your commit message and click on commit & push.
7. Now let's see the result. Go back to your GitHub repo. In the top bar, go to actions.

You will see the latest commit you just did (in this case text). After the pipeline has run, the yellow icon will turn green. Click on the commit and scroll until you see the title Deployed Branches.
