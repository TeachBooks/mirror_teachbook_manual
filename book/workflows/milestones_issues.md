# Assign task to yourself (milestones, issues)

In a repository, team members can define Milestones and Issues. Milestones are used to track the overall progress of the project to make sure that deadlines are met. A milestone can group many issues, which are individual tasks that need to be finished in order to reach the milestone.

An issue is built up of the following attributes:
- the title, this should just be a quick description of the task 
- a label, to assign a category to the task such as: new content
- an assignee, the person who created the task can assign a team-member to the task or the task can remain without an assignee. Then whoever would like to pick up the task can assign it to themselves!
- a discussion section, here team-members can discuss any questions about the task
- a due date, in case the task is urgent or to keep track of deadlines

Every team member can create issues when they think of a task that would improve the book.
