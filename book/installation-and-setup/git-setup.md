In this section you will learn how to perform basic Git actions in the online interface of GitLab.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS), used by a wide variety of engineers and software developers to work on projects in parallel together. It provides multiple benefits such as tracking changes to files, working side by side with other people, and the ability to rollback to previous versions of files without losing track of newer changes. It is a free and open sources software.

## What is GitLab?

GitLab is a cloud-based version control system built around git. It provides a lot more features such as Issues, Merge Requests, CI/CD pipelines, etc. TU Delft has a license to use GitLab on our own local webservers—this means that all of the files are stored digitally on the TU Delft campus, rather than some unkown webserver that could be physically located in an unsafe location. This is also why we have our “own” GitLab located at gitlab.tudelft.nl, rather than the “normal” GitLab at gitlab.com.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is the same service as GitLab, but it's part of a commercial company (Microsoft). It's the most well-known cloud-based git provider and provides a lot of functionalities for free for education. It also allows you to host websites on `github.io` eliminating the need for your own / TU Delft webserver, although you don't have full servercontrol.

## Terminology
This is a (non-exhaustive) list of terminology that will be used in Git.

- Repository: a collection of files and folders, along with a history of their changes and who made them. 
- Commit: a snapshot of the current state of the repository.
- Branch: a development line.
- Pushing: uploading new commits to the remote repository.

## Additional lessons
Software carpentry offers git-lessons if you'd like to learn more than just it's specific use for TeachBooks. The lessons are available [online](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and TU Delft offers these as part of a [Software Carpentry workshop](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshops)
